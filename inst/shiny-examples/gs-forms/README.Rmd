## To embed a google form

When you create a Google form ([Instuctions here](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/87809?hl=en)), Google provides the HTML to embed the form in a website. 
```
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/SOME_LONG_KEY/viewform?embedded=true" width="760" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>
```
You can wrap that with `HTML()` in `ui.R`, or reconstruct the HTML using Shiny's tags$iframe function. 

```
    tags$iframe(id = "googleform",
               src = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/SOME_LONG_KEY/viewform?embedded=true",
               width= 400,
               height= 600,
               frameborder=0,
               marginheight=0)
```
**Note that when you run the app locally, you must use "Open in Browser" in order to see the embedded Google Form!**
