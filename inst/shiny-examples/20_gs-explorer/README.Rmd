## Description

This app is currently deployed [here](https://jennybc.shinyapps.io/20_gs-explorer). 

**My Google Sheets Explorer** allows any user to log in using their Google account. After authorization, the user is presented with a listing of all their Google Sheets. The user is allowed to select a Sheet of interest and additional details about the Sheet will be presented in the `Sheet Info` tab. The user is also allowed to quickly inspect the worksheets that live in the selected Sheet by going to the `Sheet Inspection` tab. Simply select a worksheet and a visual representation of the worksheet is displayed.

## Running app locally 

`googlesheets` currently has set up web application credentials in Google Developer Console. If you are creating an app locally, default app credentials are built into `googlesheets`, __but remember to run your app using `runApp(port = 4642)`__. Credentials are accessible through:

```{r}
getOption("googlesheets.webapp.client_id")
getOption("googlesheets.webapp.client_secret")
getOption("googlesheets.webapp.redirect_uri")
```

Two functions are used to get authorization working: `gs_shiny_get_url()` and `gs_shiny_get_token()`.

The general flow is:

1. User clicks a button that will take them to the URL formed by `gs_shiny_get_url()`.  
```{r}
# looks like this
gs_webapp_auth_url()
```
2. User authenticates is redirected back to app. An authorization code also gets returned in the url, which it can be extracted using `parseQueryString(session$clientData$url_search)$code`. 

3. Use `gs_shiny_get_token()` to extract the authorization code, make a POST request to exchange for an access token, and put the token in the internal `googlesheets` environment for use in subsequent API requests.

## Setting up authorization in your own app

You must create your own web application in [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Obtain the client ID, client secret and set the redirect URI to some static local url ie. `http://127.0.0.1:4642` (for testing so every time you would run `runApp(port = 4642)` ). Depending on where you will deploy your app, you will later come back and add that destination as another redirect uri. You also need to enable the access to the Google Drive API.

After setting up the web application, in your `server.R` set client ID and secret, and redirect uri specific to your project by:

```
options("googlesheets.shiny.client_id" = MY_CLIENT_ID)
options("googlesheets.shiny.client_secret" = MY_CLIENT_SECRET)
options("googlesheets.shiny.redirect_uri" = MY_REDIRECT_URI)
```

You should store the credentials outside your codebase, e.g. in your .Rprofile.
