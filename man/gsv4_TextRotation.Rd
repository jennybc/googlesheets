gsv4_TextRotation(angle = NULL, vertical = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{angle}{integer. The angle between the standard orientation and the desired orientation.
Measured in degrees. Valid values are between -90 and 90. Positive
angles are angled upwards, negative are angled downwards.

Note: For LTR text direction positive angles are in the counterclockwise
direction, whereas for RTL they are in the clockwise direction}

\item{vertical}{logical. If TRUE, text reads top to bottom, but the orientation of individual
