\title{Exchange authorization code for an access token}
\usage{
gs_webapp_get_token(auth_code,
  client_id = getOption("googlesheets.webapp.client_id"),
  client_secret = getOption("googlesheets.webapp.client_secret"),
  redirect_uri = getOption("googlesheets.webapp.redirect_uri"))
}
\arguments{
\item{auth_code}{authorization code returned by Google that appears in URL}

\item{client_id}{client id obtained from Google Developers Console}

\item{client_secret}{client secret obtained from Google Developers Console}

\item{redirect_uri}{redirect_uri where the response is sent, should be one of the
redirect_uri values listed for the project in Google's Developer Console,

}
\description{
Use the authorization code in the return URL to exchange for an access_token
by making an HTTPS POST.

This function behaves similarly to gs_auth(). A token object gets stored in
an environment variable and retrieved when making calls to the Google Sheets
and Drive APIs.
